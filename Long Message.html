<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 1em">   "If I would have given a chance to say something before my last breath 
I would say that I love you until my death 
We will wait for years
But I have no fears 
My love for you is undying
If I lose you what is the sense of living?
Your love to me is everything
And for you, I’ll do anything 
You are not here beside me
But I hope someday you’ll be
